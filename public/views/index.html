                <h1> Application Info</h1>
                <p> This App is built on Node.JS and it uses Angular, MongoDB, Express, Facebook Graph API, XMPP, Cron.

                    If you are interested, here's the code on GitHub. (github image)

                    What this app is great for: If you have a boring day in front of you, why not take a few moments to write thoughtful messages to your friends for their birthdays and schedule to send it to them on their birthday.

                    This app will send a personal message using Facebook's chat functionality to any of your friends. It's great for never forgetting to remember another person's birthday. (chat)

                    <h3>Limitations </h3>
                    <li>1. Some users do not share their personal data on Facebook. You will not have access to their birthdates. </li>

                    <li>2. This app does not let you post on others' walls. You have Facebook for that and recently Facebook took away the functionality to post to others walls automatically from a third party application. </li>

                    <li>3. Currently, you cannot stop a message after you scheduled it.</li>
                </p>

                    <p> <h1>Future Functionality </h1>
                        <li>1. You can manually add a person's birthday on here if they don't already have it. (database insertion). </li>
                        <li>2.Subscription to e-mail functionality reminding you everyday whose birthday it is. (e-mail) </li>
                        <li>3. Ability to cancel future jobs. (cancel logo) </li>
                        <li>4. Ability to edit future messages.</li>
                    </p>
